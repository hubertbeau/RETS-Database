At the list price net number to builder is in the 80,000 range after obtaining approvals and constructing road and other costs associated with developing the 34 lots. Don't be left holding the bag when this virus goes away and the market is back in full swing. Start the approval process not for a 2021 build. Seller is to wait for approvals to close. Or check out the possibilities of just subdividing off 3 to 5 lots and use this as you equestrian oasis. Pastures and riding rink in place. Barn has 5 stalls and is heated. 2nd floor was location of former care. Sell of the house and some frontage lots and build you estate home in the far corners of the property.

During this time Fuller owned the famous, albeit contentious, 1968 Kentucky Derby Winner Dancers Image.   This offering constitutes the substantial working equestrian Farm at Runnymede. The Farm is comprised of a 4080 sf barn, 3000 sf caretaker residence, expansive paddocks, a riding/jumping arena and other high-end equestrian amenities. The barn boasts 12 stalls, a central hay drop, bathing bay with hot and cold water, heated tack room, office, kitchen and two 1/2 baths. There is an outdoor kitchen and fire pit to enjoy during the Seacoast s warmer 3 seasons. An additional 1150 sf barn provides additional equestrian possibilities and storage. In addition, significant infrastructure has been upgraded to provide for a potential indoor riding ring or for a potential estate lot.
